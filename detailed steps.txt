JAVA JENKINS PROJECT
CI:
-> made a EC2 medium instance
-> then follow Install_Jenkins.md upto Docker pipeline plugin
-> then make pipeline in New Item
-> Pipeline: pipeline script from SCM -> Git vica versa
-> Q: jenkin file can be anywhere and can be of any name
-> Q: Java application and can run other programs too by
. installing Plugins git and nodejs(e.g.)
. Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Config. > add NodeJS under NodeJS section
. now create new Pipeline and configure it and run it 
-> We are docker as agent for running our jenkin pipeline because of efficiency and more work on single shit 
-> download docker pipeline plugin and SonarQube Scanner
-> install SonarQube steps in Readme
-> Go to account > Security > generate Token (e.g. jenkins)
-> go jenkin manage cred. > system > global cred. > add new cred 
. SonarQube
. secret : token
. ID (anything) 
-> Install Docker form Install_Jenkins
-> restart Jenkins @{ec2_ip}:8080/restart
-> we don't need to put actual credentials in the Jenkins file we can use .env variables for that which we can make again in cred. > system > global cred. > add new cred under username and password section
. for docker-cred => id: docker-cred username and password will be of dockerhub
. for gihub: Secret text(as GitHub has access token and access key) same id and secrete from (developer setting-> access token classic -> make )
CD part:
-> enter minikube on local machine
-> install ArgoCD from operatorhub.io (steps would be on ArgoCD folder)
-> kubectl get svc  -n argocd => kubectl edit svc {name_of_argocd_service}  -n argocd
. change type to NodePort from ClusterIP
-> minikube service argodc-server -n argocd
-> minikube service list
-> On url: admin:admin and password
. kubectl get secret -n argocd
. kubectl edit secret {something_argocd-cluster} -n argocd
. copy admin.password
. echo {password} | base64 -d
. copy the actual password without % 
-> and login
-> new project
. Sync policy: Automatic
. url: GitHub repo
. path: manifest{folder_not_file}
. namespace: default
. cluster URL: same given
